	<p>This is a negative test for FDO principle 
	<a href="https://w3id.org/ro/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7782262;FDO-GR1">FDO-GR1</a>:
	<q>A PID, standing for a globally unique, persistent and resolvable identifier, is assumed to be the basis for FAIR Digital Objects. Every FDO is assigned one or more PIDs.</q>

	This test deliberately have a name with the <kbd>!</kbd> character which is not valid as a PID

	used both for a non-resolvable PID and for a URI which have no corresponding PID.
