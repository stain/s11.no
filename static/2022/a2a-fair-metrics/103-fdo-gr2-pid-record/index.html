	<p>This is a test for FDO principle 
	<a href="https://w3id.org/ro/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7782262;FDO-GR2">FDO-GR2</a>:
	<q>A PID resolves to a structured record (PID Record) compliant with a specified PID Profile which leads to resolution results that enable programmatic resolution from PID back to the FDO and its elements as specified by these requirements. PID Records represent the information characterizing FDOs and together with their resolving PIDs they can be themselves FDOs.</q>

		The link relations on this HTTP resource constitutes the <em>PID record</em> following
