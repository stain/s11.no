## Biography

Stian Soiland-Reyes is a Senior Lecturer in FAIR, Open and Reproducible Digital Research and co-leader of the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/ "eScience Lab at The University of Manchester") in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester. 

In his research he is working on _reproducibility_, _provenance_ and _metadata_ to improve [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/ "FAIR principles") sharing of open research data and [computational workflows](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00033), within [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), European Open Science Cloud ([EOSC](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en)) projects and the workflow repository [WorkflowHub.eu](https://workflowhub.eu/), as well as building [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) approaches for [computational workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/) and [FAIR Digital Objects](https://fairdo.org/). Stian contributed to the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) standard and its [implementation in workflow systems](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz095 "Sharing interoperable workflow provenance: A review of best practices and their practical application in CWLProv"). 

As one of the early founders of the [Research Object](https://www.researchobject.org/) approach for sharing research outputs using Linked Data, he is the co-lead of [**RO-Crate**](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), a community-based lightweight approach to [packaging and publishing research data](https://www.researchobject.org/2021-packaging-research-artefacts-with-ro-crate/) with structured metadata. RO-Crate has been recognized for the [EOSC Interoperability Framework](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10843882).

He is a strong proponent of using open Web standards, including the use of [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/) to enable machine-actionable navigation to open data. 

Stian is on the leadership team of [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/), a standard for [interoperable computational workflows](/2022/phd/methods-included/), and he was on the technical steering committee for [BioCompute Object](https://www.biocomputeobject.org/), an approach for describing workflows for submission to regulatory authorities. Stian is the Technical and Community Advisor for the [Workflows Community Initiative](https://workflows.community/) where he contributes to the task force [FAIR Computational Workflows](https://workflows.community/groups/fair/). 

Stian graduated with a BSc (2003) and [MSc](https://doi.org/11250/251073) (2007) in Computer Science from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no/) and in 2025 defended his [PhD thesis](../phd/) at the [Informatics Institute of University of Amsterdam](https://ivi.uva.nl/). 

He has more than two decades of experience as an IT professional, including 16 years as a software developer working across academia and industry. He joined the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/ "eScience Lab") in 2005 (then called the [myGrid team](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/)), where he became the _Technical Lead Developer_ of the open-source scientific workflow management system [Taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/). As part of the EU FP7-funded [Wf4Ever project](/2020/archive/wf4ever/), Stian contributed to the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/ "W3C PROV-Overview") specifications for capturing provenance and co-developed the [Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/) model and ontologies.  More recently Stian has continued this passion for reproducibility, structured metadata and open scholarship with engagement in several projects related to FAIR, computational workflows, and RO-Crate. 

In 2023, Stian became a _Research Fellow_, and in November 2023 he was promoted to _Senior Lecturer_ at the Department of Computer Science, taking up teaching duties, supervision and co-leadership of the eScience Lab.
