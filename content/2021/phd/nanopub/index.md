## Abstract

While the publication of Linked Data has become increasingly common, the process tends to be a relatively complicated and heavy-weight one.
Linked Data is typically published by centralized entities in the form of larger dataset releases, which has the downsides that there is a central bottleneck in the form of the organization or individual responsible for the releases. Moreover, certain kinds of data entries, in particular those with subjective or original content, currently do not fit into any existing dataset and are therefore more difficult to publish.

To address these problems, we present here an approach to use nanopublications and a decentralized network of services to allow users to directly publish small Linked Data statements through a simple and user-friendly interface, called _Nanobench_, powered by semantic templates that are themselves published as nanopublications. The published nanopublications are cryptographically verifiable and can be queried through a redundant and decentralized network of services, based on the grlc API generator and a new quad extension of Triple Pattern Fragments.

We show here that these two kinds of services are complementary and together allow us to query nanopublications in a reliable and efficient manner. We also show that Nanobench makes it indeed very easy for users to publish Linked Data statements, even for those who have no prior experience in Linked Data publishing.



## Introduction

Linked Data has achieved remarkable adoption \[1--2\], but its
publication has remained a complicated issue. The most popular methods
for publishing Linked Data include subject pages \[3\], SPARQL
endpoints \[4\], and data dumps. The latter are essentially just RDF
files on the web. Such files are not regularly indexed on a global scale
by any of the existing search engines and therefore often lack
discoverability, but they are the only option that does not require the
setup of a web server for users wanting to publish Linked Data on their
own. 

While one of the fundamental ideas behind the web is that anyone
should be able to express themselves, Linked Data publishing is
therefore mostly done by large centralized entities such as DBpedia
\[5\] and Wikidata \[6\]. Even such community-driven datasets have clear
guidelines on what kind of data may be added and typically do not allow
for subjective or original content, such as personal opinions or new
scientific findings that have otherwise not yet been published. It is
therefore difficult for web users to publish their own personal pieces
of Linked Data in a manner that the published data can be easily
discovered, queried, and aggregated. 

To solve these shortcomings, we
propose here a complementary approach to allow for what we call semantic
micro-contributions. In contrast to the existing Linked Data publishing
paradigms, semantic micro-contributions allow individual web users to
easily and independently publish small snippets of Linked Data. 

We show
below how such semantic micro-contributions can be achieved with
nanopublications and semantic templates, and how we can make such a
system redundant and reliable with a decentralized network of services.
We will explain below how this approach differs from other
decentralization approaches that have been proposed in the context of
Linked Data publishing (including Solid and Blockchain-based
approaches).

Concretely, we investigate here the research question of how we can
build upon the existing nanopublication publishing ecosystem to provide
query services and intuitive user interfaces that allow for quick and
easy publishing of small Linked Data contributions in a decentralized
fashion. Our concrete contributions are:

1.  a concrete scheme of how nanopublications can be digitally signed
    and thereby reliably linked to user identities,

2.  two complementary sets of nanopublication query services building
    upon extensions of existing Linked Data technologies, one based on
    the grlc API generator and the other one in the form of an extension
    of Triple Pattern Fragments called Quad Pattern Fragments (QPF),

3.  a user interface connecting to these services that allows for simple
    nanopublication publishing based on the new concept of
    nanopublication templates, and

4.  positive evaluation results on the above-mentioned query services
    and user interface.

Below, we outline the relevant background, introduce the details of our
approach, present and discuss the design and results of two evaluations,
and outline future work.

## Background

Before we introduce our approach, we give here the relevant background
in terms of our own previous work, and other related research on the
topics of the use of semantic technologies for scientific publishing,
Linked Data APIs, and decentralization.

Under the label of *semantic publishing* \[7\], a number of approaches
have been presented to align research and its outcomes with Linked Data
in order to better organize, aggregate, and interpret scientific
findings and science as a whole. We have previously argued that these
Linked Data representations should ideally come directly from the
authors (i.e. the researchers), should cover not just metadata
properties but the content of the scientific findings themselves, and
should become the main publication object instead of papers with
narrative text, in what we called *genuine semantic publishing* \[8\].

Nanopublications \[9\] are one of the most prominent proposals to
implement this. They are small independent pieces of Linked Data that
encapsulate atomic statements in the form of a few RDF triples (this
part is called the *assertion graph*) together with formal provenance
information (the *provenance graph*, e.g. pointing to the study that the
assertion was derived from) and metadata (the *publication info graph*,
e.g. by whom and when was the nanopublication created). 

While the
original nanopublication proposal focused on assertions with domain
statements (such as expressing a link between a gene and a disease), we
subsequently suggested to broaden their scope and to use them also to
express bibliographic and other meta-level information, statements about
other nanopublications, vocabulary definitions, and generally any kind
of small and coherent snippet of Linked Data \[10\]. 

In order to make
nanopublications verifiable and to enforce their immutability, we then
showed how cryptographic hash values can be calculated on their content
and included in their identifiers in the form of *trusty URIs* \[11\].

Based on this, we established a decentralized and open server network,
through which anybody can reliably publish and retrieve nanopublications
\[12\], and we introduced index nanopublications, which allow for
assigning nanopublications to versions of larger datasets \[13\]. The
work to be presented below is a continuation of this research line,
adding query services and an intuitive publishing interface as
components to this ecosystem.

Our general approach is partly related to semantic wikis, e.g.
\[14--16\]. They combine the ideas of the Semantic Web with the wiki
concept, and therefore allow for quick and easy editing of semantic
data. They focus on the collaborative process of consensus finding and
its result in the form of a single coherent formal knowledge base, and
as such, they focus less on individual contributions as the unit of
reference.

In terms of Linked Data APIs, SPARQL endpoints \[4\] are probably the
most well-known example and they are often used for providing queryable
access to RDF datasets. In practice, such endpoints often suffer from
availability problems \[17\], due to their public nature and the
uncontrolled complexity of SPARQL queries. 

The Linked Data Fragments
(LDF) framework \[18\] was initiated as an attempt to investigate
alternative RDF query interfaces, where the total query effort can be
distributed between server and client. Triple Pattern Fragments
(TPF) \[18\], for example, heavily reduce the expressivity of queries
that can be evaluated by a server, so clients that want answers to more
complex SPARQL queries need to take up part of the execution load
themselves. Through client-side query engines, such as Comunica \[19\],
complex SPARQL queries can be split into multiple triple pattern queries
that can be executed separately by a TPF server and then joined to
create the full result on the client-side. 

Another approach to address
the problems of full SPARQL endpoints is grlc \[20\], a tool that
automatically generates APIs from SPARQL templates. By providing a small
number of possible API operations instead of SPARQL's virtually
unlimited query possibilities, grlc makes Linked Data access easier and
better manageable on both, the client and server side. A further
noteworthy technology is the Linked Data Platform (LDP) \[21\] to manage
and provide Linked Data. 

In order to establish connections between
producers and consumers of Linked Data, subscription and notification
protocols such as [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) and [provenance pingbacks](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/#provenance-pingback) have been
proposed.

The approaches above mostly assume requests are targeted towards a
central server. This centralization comes with the downsides that such a
server forms a single point of failure, that we need to trust in the
authority that runs it, and that it is difficult to scale. 

To address these problems, a number of more decentralized approaches have been
proposed. LDF interfaces such as TPF, as introduced above, can in fact
also be used in a more distributed fashion, as fragments can be
published across different servers \[22\]. Distributed approaches to
semantically annotate web pages like schema.org \[23\] have moreover
shown strong adoption. 

Another example is Solid \[35\], where
users have their own personal Linked Data pod, in which they can store
their own data and thereby are in full control of who can access it.
Solid thereby targets personal and potentially confidential data, with a
focus on access control and minimizing data duplication. The Solid
ecosystem has been applied in a number of use cases, such as
collaboration within decentralized construction projects \[24\], and
decentralization of citizen data within governments \[25\]. 

Such
approaches where data is distributed but not replicated, however, often
lead to major difficulties when queries need to be executed over such a
federation of data sources \[26\].

This stands in contrast to decentralized approaches where data is not
only distributed but also replicated, which typically target open and
public data and have an emphasis on scalability and reliability.
Blockchain-based solutions fall into the latter category, for which a
whole range exists of possible approaches to integrate Linked Data
\[27\]. 

A core trade-off of all blockchain-based approaches is to either
sacrifice some degree of decentralization with permissioned blockchains
or to pay the price of the expensive mining process. For applications
that do not crucially depend on a fixed and agreed-upon order of events,
as cryptocurrencies do for their transaction ledger, the costs of
Blockchain-based solutions in fact often do not seem to offset their
benefits. 

Our approach to be presented below also falls into this second
category of decentralization approaches with replicated data sources,
but does not entail the costs of Blockchain-based approaches.

## Approach

{{< figure src="figure1.svg" link="figure1.svg" id="fig:querysuccess" 
width="100%" title="Nanopublication services"
caption="The architecture of our overall approach" >}}

The approach to be presented here, as shown in [Figure 1](#fig:approach), is
based on our work on nanopublications and the ecosystem for publishing
them, as introduced above. The core of this new approach is to allow
end-users to directly publish Linked Data snippets in the form of
nanopublications with our existing decentralized nanopublication
publishing network through an interface powered by semantic templates,
which are themselves published as nanopublications. 

Below we explain how
users can establish their identity by announcing their public key, and
how they can then sign, publish, and update their nanopublications. Then
we describe our extension of Triple Pattern Fragments to support quads
and thereby nanopublications. Next, we show how we defined two
complementary sets of services on top of the existing nanopublication
network to query and access the published data in a redundant and
reliable way. Finally, we explain how these components together with
semantic templates allowed us to build a flexible and intuitive end-user
application called *Nanobench*.

### Identities and Updates

Nanopublications typically specify their creator in the publication info
graph, but because anybody can publish anything they want through the
existing open nanopublication network, there is no guarantee that this
creator link is accurate. 

For that reason, we propose here a method to
add a digital signature to the publication graph. With our approach,
users have to first introduce their identifier and public key before
they can publish their own nanopublications. This introduction is itself
published as a signed nanopublication declaring the link between the
personal identifier (such as an ORCID identifier) and the public key in
its assertion graph, as shown by this example:

    sub:assertion {
      sub:keyDeclaration npx:declaredBy orcid:0000-0001-2345-6789 ;
        npx:hasAlgorithm "RSA" ;
        npx:hasPublicKey "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQK..." .
    }

Below, we will come back to the question of how we can ensure that this
user is indeed in control of the stated ORCID identifier. Once an
identity is established in this way, the respective user can publish
nanopublications such as the one shown in [Figure 2](#fig:nanopub), where
the personal identifier and the public key are mentioned in the
publication info graph (yellow) together with the digital signature that
is calculated with the respective private key on the entire
nanopublication, excluding only the `npx:hasSignature` triple and the
hash code of the trusty URI. 

The trusty URI (here represented with the
prefix `this:`) is calculated as a last step, which therefore also
covers the signature. This makes the nanopublication including its
signature verifiable and immutable.

{{< figure src="figure2.svg" link="figure2.svg" id="fig:nanopub" 
width="100%" title="Example nanopublication"
caption="in TriG notation, as published with Nanobench" >}}

Immutability is a desirable property to ensure stable and reliable
linking, but for practical purposes it has to come with a mechanism to
declare updates and mark obsolete entries. With our approach, new
versions of a nanopublication can be declared with the `npx:supersedes` property in the
publication info graph of the nanopublication containing the update, for
example:

    sub:pubinfo {
      this: npx:supersedes
        <http://purl.org/np/RAvjbXCGsF1R03yUjeAHC2arCGqTtn5BThOEkz4HPfPrc> .
      ...
    }

In order to declare a nanopublication obsolete without an update, the `npx:retracts`
property can be used in the assertion graph of a separate retraction
nanopublication, for example:

    sub:assertion {
      orcid:0000-0001-2345-6789 npx:retracts
        <http://purl.org/np/RALS50Z57WzbjVsj2mZLAIX34_GicNnn2RMAlZd-yjpYo> .
    }

Of course, updated versions and retractions should only be considered
valid if authorized by the author of the original nanopublication. For
the scope of this work, we only consider them valid if the retraction or
update is signed with the same key pair, but more flexible solutions are
possible in the future.

The elements introduced so far allow us to cryptographically verify that
given nanopublications were published by the same user who introduced
herself in her introduction nanopublication, but they still allow
anybody to claim any ORCID identifier (or other kind of identifier). 

To add this missing link, users can add the link of their introduction
nanopublication to their ORCID profile under _"Websites & Social Links"_,
which proves that they have control of that account. This link is
represented with `foaf:page` when the user identifier is resolved with a
HTTP GET request asking for an RDF representation via content
negotiation. 

This is thereby a general method that can work on any URL
scheme and identification mechanism providing dereferenceable user
identifiers, but for simplicity we will restrict our discussion here to
ORCID identifiers.

### Quad Pattern Fragments

Nanopublications, as can be seen in [Figure 2](#fig:nanopub), are
represented as four named RDF graphs. Triple Pattern Fragments, however,
as their names indicates, only support triples and not quads (which
include the graph information), and TPF is therefore insufficient for
querying nanopublications. For this reason, we introduce an extension of
TPF to support quads, called [Quad Pattern Fragments](https://linkeddatafragments.org/specification/quad-pattern-fragments/) (QPF).

In order to allow querying over QPF, its HTTP responses include metadata
that declaratively describe the controls via which querying is possible.
These controls are defined a similar way as for TPF using the Hydra Core
vocabulary \[28\], and allows intelligent query engines to detect and
use them. Below, an example of these controls is shown:

    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.
    @prefix hydra: <http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#>.
    @prefix void: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#>.
    @prefix sd: <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/#>.

    <https://example.org/#dataset> a void:Dataset, hydra:Collection;
        void:subset <https://example.org/>;
        sd:defaultGraph <urn:ldf:defaultGraph>;
        hydra:search _:pattern.
    _:pattern hydra:template "https://example.org/{?s,p,o,g}";
        hydra:variableRepresentation hydra:ExplicitRepresentation;
        hydra:mapping _:subject, _:predicate, _:object, _:graph.
    _:subject hydra:variable "s";
        hydra:property rdf:subject.
    _:predicate hydra:variable "p";
        hydra:property rdf:predicate.
    _:object hydra:variable "o";
        hydra:property rdf:object.
    _:graph hydra:variable "g";
        hydra:property sd:graph.

The control above indicates that the QPF API accepts four URL
parameters, corresponding to the four elements of a quad. For example, a
query to this API for the pattern `?s npx:retracts ?o sub:assertion`
would result in an HTTP request for the URL
`<https://example.org/?p=npx:retracts&g=sub:assertion>`[^1].

Just like with TPF, intelligent clients can be built that can handle
more complex queries (such as SPARQL queries) over QPF APIs. This
requires these clients to split up a SPARQL query into multiple quad
patterns, which can be resolved by the API, after which they can be
joined by the client to form a complete query result.

QPF has been designed to be backwards-compatible with TPF. This means
that clients that implement support for TPF APIs, but do not understand
the notion of QPF, will be able to recognise the API as TPF, and execute
triple pattern queries against it. Due to the declaratively described
QPF and TPF controls, clients such as the Comunica engine can recognize
and make use of both variants next to each other. A live version of a
QPF API can be found at <https://ldf.nanopubs.knows.idlab.ugent.be/np>,
which is one of six instances of this service in our network[^2].

[^1]: For simplicity, URLs for `p` and `g` are prefixed, whereas they
    will be expanded in practise.

    found at
    <http://query.linkeddatafragments.org/#datasources=https%3A//ldf.nanopubs.knows.idlab.ugent.be/np>


### Nanopublication Services

Nanopublications can be reliably and redundantly published by uploading
them to the existing nanopublication server network \[12\], which at the
time of writing consists of eleven severs in five countries and storing
more than [10 million nanopublications](http://purl.org/nanopub/monitor). This network implements a
basic publishing layer where nanopublications can be looked up by their
trusty URI, but no querying features are provided.

In order to allow for querying of the nanopublications' content, we
present here our implementation of a new service layer built on top of
the existing publication layer. While we are using a triple store with
SPARQL under the hood, we do not provide a full-blown SPARQL endpoint to
users in order to address the above-mentioned problems of availability
and scalability. 

For our nanopublication service layer, we employ a mix
of two kinds of services that are more restricted than SPARQL but also
more scalable. The first kind of service is based on LDF via our QPF
API, as introduced above, and allows only for simple queries at the
level of individual RDF statements but does not impose further
restrictions. The second one is based on the grlc API generator \[20\],
which optionally comes with the Tapas HTML interface \[29\] and which
can be used to execute complex queries but is restricted to a small
number of predefined patterns.

The LDF-based services reduce the complexity and load on the server by
only allowing for very simple queries to be asked to the server, and
delegate the responsibility of orchestrating them to answer more complex
questions to the client. 

The grlc-based services reduce the complexity
and load by allowing only for queries that are based on a small number
of SPARQL templates that are hand-crafted for optimized performance.
These two kinds of services are thereby designed to be complementary,
with grlc being restricted but faster and LDF being more powerful but
slower.

The grlc-based services provide general API operations that are based on
14 SPARQL templates:

-   `find_nanopubs` returns all nanopublication identifiers in undefined order
    (paginated in groups of 1000) possibly restricted by the year,
    month, or day of creation;

-   `find_nanopubs_with_pattern` additionally allows for specifying the subject, predicate, and/or
    object of a triple in the nanopublication as a filter, and to
    restrict the occurrence of that triple to the assertion, provenance,
    or publication info graph;

-   `find_nanopubs_with_uri` similarly allows for filtering by a URI irrespective of its triple
    position;

-   `find_nanopubs_with_text` supports full-text search on the literals in the nanopublication
    (using non-standard SPARQL features available in Virtuoso and
    GraphDB);

-   `get_all_indexes` for each of the four templates mentioned above, there is also a
    `find_signed_nanopubs_*` version that only returns nanopublications that have a valid
    signature and that allows for filtering by public key;

-   `get_all_users` returns all nanopublication indexes (i.e. sets of nanopublications);

-   `get_backlinks` returns all users who announced a public key via an introduction
    nanopublication;

-   `get_deep_backlinks` returns all identifiers of nanopublications that directly point to a
    given nanopublication;

-   `get_latest_version` does the same thing but includes deep links through chains of
    nanopublications linking to the given one;

-   `get_nanopub_count` returns the latest version of a given nanopublication signed by the
    same public key by following `npx:supersedes` backlinks;

-   `get_nanopub_count` returns the number of nanopublications, possibly restricted by year,
    month, or day of creation.

The full SPARQL templates can be found in the supplemental material (see
below). These API calls provide a general set of queries based on which
applications with more complex behavior can be built. We will introduce
Nanobench as an example of such an application below.

In order to answer some of the above queries, auxiliary data structures
have to be created while loading new nanopublications. Most importantly,
digital signatures cannot be checked in SPARQL directly, as this
involves translating the triples of a nanopublication into a normalized
serialization and then calculating a cryptographic hash function on it,
which goes beyond SPARQL's capabilities. 

Other aspects like deep
backlinks are complicated because it is not sufficient to check whether
a link is present, but we also need to check that the respective triple
is located in the linking nanopublication (as a triple linking two
nanopublications could itself be located in a third nanopublication). 

In
order to solve these problems, additional triples in two administrative
graphs are generated when new nanopublications are loaded. Concretely,
the following triples are added for each nanopublication (placeholders
in capitals):

    npa:graph {
      <NPURI> npa:hasHeadGraph <HEADURI> ;
        dct:created "DATETIME"^^xsd:dateTime ;
        npa:creationDay <http://purl.org/nanopub/admin/date/YEAR-MONTH-DAY> ;
        npa:creationMonth <http://purl.org/nanopub/admin/date/YEAR-MONTH> ;
        npa:creationYear <http://purl.org/nanopub/admin/date/YEAR> ;
        npa:hasValidSignatureForPublicKey "PUBLICKEY" .
    }
    npa:networkGraph {
      <NPURI> <INTER-NP-PREDICATE> REFERENCED-NPURIS... .
      <NPURI> npa:refersToNanopub REFERENCED-NPURIS... .
    }

The first triple of the `npa:graph` links the nanopublication identifier to its head
graph, where the links to its assertion, provenance, and publication
info graphs can be found. The second one contains the creation date in a
normalized form. Number three to five allow for efficient filtering by
day, month, and year, respectively (we use URIs instead of literals
because this happens to be much faster for filtering under Virtuoso).
The final triple in the `npa:graph` links the nanopublication to its public key if
the signature was found to be valid.

In the `npa:networkGraph`, all instances of linking to another nanopublication with the
linking nanopublication URI in subject position are added (e.g. with `npx:supersedes`).
In the cases where another nanopublication is linked but not with the
pattern of the linking nanopublication in subject position (e.g. as with `npx:retracts`), 
`npa:refersToNanopub` is used as predicate to link the two nanopublications.

We set up a network of six servers in five different countries each
providing both of the introduced services (LDF-based and grlc-based).
They are notified about new nanopublications by the servers of the
existing publishing network, which are otherwise running independently.
The services connect to a local instance of a [Virtuoso triple store](https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/),
into which all nanopublications are loaded via a connector module. This
connector module also creates the additional triples in the
administrative graphs as explained above.

While the restriction to predefined templates with grlc significantly
improves the scalability of the system as compared to unrestricted
SPARQL, further measures will be needed in the future if the number of
nanopublications keeps growing to new orders of magnitude. 

The services
presented here are designed in such a way that such measures are
possible with minimal changes to the API. The 14 query templates of the
grlc services can be distributed to different servers, for example, such
that a single server would only be responsible for one of the 14 kinds
of queries. This server could then use an optimized data structure for
exactly that kind of query and would only need to hold a fraction of the
data. 

The `find_` queries could moreover be further compartmentalized based on
publication date, for example each server instance just covering a
single year. The LDF-based services could be distributed in a similar
fashion, for example based on the predicate namespace.

### Nanobench Client and Templates

To demonstrate and evaluate our approach, we next implemented a client
application that runs on the user's local computer, can be accessed
through their web browser, and connects to the above decentralized
network of services. The [code](https://github.com/peta-pico/nanobench) can be found online and 
[Figure 3](#fig:nanobench) shows a screenshot.

In the _"search"_ part of the interface, users are provided with a simple
search interface that connects to the grlc API operations `find_nanopubs_with_uri` (if a URI is
entered in the search field) or `find_nanopubs_with_text` (otherwise). In the _"others"_ part, other
users' latest nanopublications can be seen in a feed-like manner,
similar to Twitter feeds.

In order for users to publish their own nanopublications and thereby
create their own feed, they have to first set up their profile.
Nanobench provides close guidance through this process, which involves
the declaration of the user's ORCID identifier, the creation of an RSA
key pair, and the publication of an introduction nanopublication that
links the public key to the ORCID identifier.

The last step of linking
the new introduction nanopublication from the user's ORCID profile is
not strictly necessary for the user to start publishing nanopublications
and is therefore marked as optional.

Once the user profile is completed, a list of templates is shown in the
_"publish"_ part of the interface. Templates are published as
nanopublications as well, and so this list can be populated via a call
to the `find_signed_nanopubs_with_pattern` operation of the grlc-based services. 

Currently, the list
includes templates for free-text commenting on a URL, expressing a
relation to another person, declaring that the user has read a given
paper, expressing a gene--disease association, retracting a
nanopublication, describing a datasets with a SPARQL endpoint, and
publishing an arbitrary RDF triple. After selecting a template, a form
is automatically generated that allows the user to fill in information
according to that template, as shown in [Figure 3](#fig:nanobench).

Templates describe the kind of statements users can publish and also
provide additional information on how the input form should be presented
to the user. This is an example of a template (the same one that is
shown in [Figure 3](#fig:nanobench), defined in the assertion graph of a
nanopublication:

    sub:assertion {
      sub:assertion a nt:AssertionTemplate ;
        rdfs:label "Expressing that you know somebody" ;
        nt:hasStatement sub:st1 .
      sub:st1 a rdf:Statement ;
        rdf:subject nt:CREATOR ;
        rdf:predicate foaf:knows ;
        rdf:object sub:person .
      foaf:knows rdfs:label "know" .
      sub:person a nt:UriPlaceholder ;
        rdfs:label "ORCID identifier of the person you know" ;
        nt:hasPrefix "https://orcid.org/" ;
        nt:hasRegex "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}[0-9X]" .
    }

In a template nanopublication, the assertion graph is classified as an
`AssertionTemplate` (in the namespace `https://w3id.org/np/o/ntemplate/`) and given a human readable label
with `rdfs:label`. Moreover, it is linked to the statement templates (i.e. triples
in the nanopublications to be published) via `hasStatement`. The above
example has just one such statement template, but more complex templates
involve several of them. These templates then use regular RDF
reification to point to their subjects, predicates, and objects. 

In the
case of multiple statements, their order in the form can be defined with
`statementOrder` and some of them can be marked as optional by
classifying them as `OptionalStatement`. `rdfs:label` can be used on all the elements
to define how they should be labeled in the form interface, and the
special URI `CREATOR` is mapped to the identifier of the user applying
the template.

Importantly, the URIs in subject, predicate, or object position of the
template statements can be declared placeholders with the class
`UriPlaceholder`, and similarly for literals with `LiteralPlaceholder`.
Such placeholders are represented as input elements, such as text fields
or drop-down menus, in the form that is generated from the template.

Currently supported more specific placeholder types include
`TrustyUriPlaceholder`, which requires a trusty URI (such as a
nanopublication URI), and `RestrictedChoicePlaceholder`, which leads to
a drop-down menu with the possible options defined by the property
`possibleValue`. For URI placeholders, prefixes can be defined with
`hasPrefix` and regex restrictions with `hasRegex`, as can be seen in
the example above.

Once the user filled in a form that was generated from a template and
clicks on "Publish", Nanobench creates the assertion graph of a new
nanopublication by following the template and replacing all the
placeholders with the user's input. For the provenance graph, only a
simple `prov:wasAttributedTo` link to the user's identifier is currently added (we are working
on extending the coverage of templates to the provenance and publication
info graphs). 

In the publication info graph, Nanobench adds a timestamp,
specifies the user as the creator of the nanopublication, and adds a
`wasCreatedFromTemplate` link that points to the underlying template
nanopublication. Then, Nanobench adds a digital signature element to the
publication info graph with a signature made from the user's local
private key, transforms the whole nanopublication into its final state
with a trusty URI, and finally publishes it to the server network with a
simple HTTP POST request. Within a few minutes or less, it then appears
in the user's feed.

Nanobench currently makes use of the redundancy of the nanopublication
services in a very simple way: For each query, it randomly selects two
grlc service instances and sends the same query to both. It then
processes the result as soon as it gets the first answer and discards
the second, thereby increasing the chance of success and lowering the
average waiting time. More sophisticated versions of this protocol are
of course easily imaginable and will be investigated in future work.

## Performance Evaluation

In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce here a performance
evaluation that we ran on the network of nanopublication services. In
the next section we will then look into whether these services are
useful to potential end users with a usability evaluation on Nanobench.

### Performance Evaluation Design

For this performance evaluation we wanted to find out how well the two
types of services --- LDF-based and grlc-based --- perform in our
network of services, how they compare, and to what extent they are
really complementary. For this purpose, we defined a set of concrete
queries that we can then submit to both services. 

We started with the 14
query templates of the grlc-based service, and instantiated each of them
with a simple set of parameters to make 14 concrete executable queries.
As parameter values, we chose generic yet realistically useful examples
that return non-trivial answer sets for the kind of nanopublications
that the current templates describe: 

- (1) `find_nanopubs` restricted to the month 2020-02; 
- (2) `find_nanopubs_with_pattern` with the predicate value set to `foaf:knows`; 
- (3) `find_nanopubs_with_text` on the free-text keyword _"john"_; 
- (4) `find_nanopubs_with_uri` to search for nanopublications mentioning a given ORCID identifier; 
- (5--8) of the form `find_signed_nanopubs_*` are given the same parameters as (1--4); 
- (9) `get_all_indexes` 
- (10) `get_all_users` do not need parameters; 
- (11) `get_backlinks` and 
- (12) `get_deep_backlinks` are given the URI of a specific nanopublication, which has a substantial number of backlinks; 
- (13) `get_latest_version` is given the URI of the first version of a template nanopublication that has afterwards been updated four times; 
- (14) `get_nanopub_count` is, like (1), restricted to the month 2020-02.

We can run these queries via the grlc-powered API but we can also use an
LDF engine like Comunica to run them against our LDF-based services. The
latter comes with some caveats, as the free text queries of `find_nanopubs_with_text` and `find_signed_nanopubs_with_text` depend
on implementation-dependent non-standard extensions of SPARQL that do
not work with LDF-style query execution. 

Moreover, Comunica currently
lacks support for complex property paths, which are needed for `get_deep_backlinks` and `get_latest_version`.
Queries (3), (7), (12), and (13) can therefore only be run on the
grlc-based services but not on the LDF-based ones.

However, the power of the LDF-based services is of course that they can
(potentially) run arbitrary SPARQL queries (with some restrictions, as
mentioned above). 

To demonstrate and test this ability, we created
another query (15) that in a simple way combines the outputs of two of
the currently available templates. Specifically, it checks for a given
user (below abbreviated as `me:`) who he has declared to know via the
`foaf:knows` template, and then searches for papers these people declared to have
read via a different template. Thereby, query (15) returns a list of all
papers that friends of the user `me:` have read:

    select ?person ?paper where {
      me: foaf:knows ?person .
      ?person pc:hasRead ?paper .
    }

This query can be considered a quick-and-dirty solution for exploration
purposes, as it misses a number of checks. It does not check that both
triples are in the assertion graphs of signed nanopublications, that the
first is signed with the public key corresponding to the user in subject
position, and that neither of the nanopublications is superseded or
retracted. 

We therefore define query (16) that includes all these
checks. This query is more complicated, and we show here for
illustration just the SPARQL fragment of the part necessary to check
that the second nanopublication `?np2` with public key `?pubkey2` was not retracted:

    filter not exists {
      graph npa:graph {  ?retraction npa:hasHeadGraph ?rh .
        ?retraction npa:hasValidSignatureForPublicKey ?pubkey2 .  }
      graph ?rh {  ?retraction np:hasAssertion ?ra .  }
      graph ?ra {  ?somebody npx:retracts ?np2 .  }
    }

The inconvenience of writing such rather complicated queries can be
addressed by future versions of the services, which could include
predefined options to restrict the query to the assertion graphs and to
up-to-date content. The full set of used queries and further details can
be found in the [supplemental material](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994068) online.

To evaluate the performance of the nanopublication services, we accessed
them in a clearly defined setting from a number of different locations
from personal computers via home networks, by running the 16 queries
specified above on all service instances of both kinds. 

For that, we
created a Docker image that accesses the grlc-based services with simple
HTTP requests via `curl` and the LDF-based ones with the [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) engine
1.12.1. The results as well as the execution time of all the calls are
recorded, which is then used to evaluate the performance. For both kinds
of services, the timeout is set to 60 seconds.

### Performance Evaluation Results

We ran the Dockerized evaluation process described above at five places
in four different countries. Each of them ran all of the compatible
queries on each of the six existing service instance for both of the two
kinds. 

For each query we therefore have 30 outcomes for grlc and another
30 outcomes for LDF. These outcomes fall into the general categories of
timeout, error, and full result. In the case of the LDF-based services,
timeout and error outcomes can come with partial results.
[Figure 4](#fig:querysuccess) shows a summary of these overall outcomes.

{{< figure src="figure4.svg" link="figure4.svg" id="fig:querysuccess" 
width="100%" title="Query outcomes"
caption="Overall outcomes per query and kind of service, executed from five locations" >}}

With grlc, 96% of the calls succeeded and only 4% resulted in an error
(mostly due to downtime of one particular service). With LDF, 73% fully
succeeded, 21% reached the timeout, and 6% gave an error. The latter two
sometimes gave partial results: overall 6% reached a timeout while still
giving partial results, and overall 3% gave an error with a partial
result. 

For LDF, these types of outcomes are not evenly distributed. Two
queries --- `find_nanopubs_with_uri` (4) and `get_all_indexes` (9) --- never fully succeeded, but the former
sometimes gave partial results. For the remaining queries, however,
these LDF calls returned at least a partial result in 97% of the cases.
Except for query (1) in addition to the above mentioned (4) and (9), the
full result was always received from at least one of the servers in LDF
mode. For grlc, this was the case for all queries. A client checking
multiple servers would therefore have eventually received the full
result. For query (1) in LDF mode, this was true for 4 cases out of 5.

| Query | grlc | LDF | L/g |
| ----- | ---- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `find_nanopubs` | 1.02 | 35.26 | 34.48 |
| 2 | `find_nanopubs_with_pattern` | 0.55 | 6.69 | 12.20 |
| 3 | `find_nanopubs_with_text` | 6.46 |  |  |
| 4 | `find_nanopubs_with_uri` | 0.78 |  | |
| 5 | `find_signed_nanopubs` | 0.49 | 20.77 | 42.05 |
| 6 | `find_signed_nanopubs_with_pattern` | 0.73 | 9.57 | 13.04 |
| 7 | `find_signed_nanopubs_with_text` | 1.54 |  |  |
| 8 | `find_signed_nanopubs_with_uri` | 0.34 | 29.53 | 86.50 |
| 9 | `get_all_indexes` | 3.52 | |  |
| 10 | `get_all_users` | 0.65 | 31.09 | 47.71 |
| 11 | `get_backlinks` | 0.21 | 1.53 | 7.18 |
| 12 | `get_deep_backlinks` | 0.68 |  |  |
| 13 | `get_latest_version` | 0.71 |  |  |
| 14 | `get_nanopub_count` | 0.23 | 6.54 | 28.29 |
| 15 | `papers` |  | 2.30 |  |
| 16 | `papers_x` |  | 10.07 |  |

_**Table 1**: Average execution times of the successful query executions in seconds. Cite as: <https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.387/table-1>_

Next, we can look at the time performance. Table 1 shows the average execution times per query
and service type, including only the calls that returned a full result.
The successful queries to the grlc services took on average from 0.21 to
6.46 seconds. 

For the LDF services, these numbers range from 1.53 to
35.26 seconds (but they can be a bit misleading as they ignore the fact
that the LDF services repeatedly hit the time limit of 60 seconds). For
the queries that could successfully be run on both kinds of services,
LDF is on average 7.18 to 86.50 times slower than grlc.

Importantly, the queries that do not follow a predefined pattern (15)
and (16) gave the full result with LDF in 97% of the cases and ran
reasonably fast. The quick-and-dirty version (15) required on average
2.30 seconds, whereas the thorough one (16) completed on average after
10.07 seconds.

## Usability Evaluation

Now that we know that the services perform reasonably well, we wanted to
find out whether this general approach and our specific Nanobench tool
indeed makes it easy for users who might not be experts in Linked Data
to publish their own small data entries.

### Usability Evaluation Design

We wanted to test the usability of Nanobench in a real setting, where
users actually publish nanopublications. For that we wrote detailed
instructions on how to install and use Nanobench and its publication
feature, which includes downloading the latest Nanobench release,
running it locally, accessing Nanobench through their web browser,
completing the Nanobench profile, accessing the list of templates, and
finally filling in and submitting the publication form generated from a
chosen template. Through mailing lists, social media, and personal
contacts, we tried to convince as many people as possible to try out
Nanobench and to publish some nanopublications on their own.

Next, we created an anonymous usability questionnaire, consisting of the
ten standard questions of the widely used System Usability Scale (SUS)
\[30\]. We added to that the questions _"Have you published RDF / Linked
Data before?"_ and _"Have you digitally signed RDF / Linked Data before?"_,
and as a follow up to each of them --- if the answer was "yes" ---
whether Nanobench was harder or easier to use for publishing and signing
Linked Data, respectively, compared to how they previously did it. The
responses were on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Nanobench was harder)
to 5 (Nanobench was easier).

We sent this questionnaire to all the Nanobench users who published at
least one nanopublication (not counting their introduction
nanopublication), excluding the co-authors of this paper and their close
relatives. Further details, including instructions and questionnaire,
can be found in the [supplemental material](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3994066) online.

### Usability Evaluation Results

Overall, 42 users registered in the decentralized system by publishing
an introduction nanopublication. 29 of them (69%) also linked this
introduction nanopublication from their ORCID accounts, which was a step
that was marked as optional.  Collectively, they published 81
nanopublications, not counting their introduction nanopublications, via
the use of seven distinct templates. 

After applying the exclusion
criteria defined above, we arrived at a set of 29 users to whom we sent
the anonymous usability questionnaire (this set of users is overlapping
but different from the set of 29 users mentioned just above). After
sending up to two reminders, we received responses from all of them.

On the question of whether they had published Linked Data before, 21
respondents (72%) said they did. 20 of them (95%) reported that
Nanobench was easier to use compared to how they previously published
Linked Data, with the remaining one being indifferent (score of 3). The
average was 4.5 on the 5-point Likert scale. Of the 21 respondents, only
three (14%) stated that they had previously digitally signed Linked
Data. All three of them found Nanobench easier, giving two times a 5 and
once a 4 as responses (average 4.7).

_**Table 2**: SUS usability evaluation results. Cite as: <https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.387/table-2>_

Table 2 shows the results of the SUS questions.
Overall, our system achieved a SUS score of 77.76, which is clearly
above the average score reported in the literature (70.14) and is
roughly in the middle between "good" and "excellent" on an adjective
scale \[31\]. Interestingly, if we only consider the eight respondents
who stated they had never published Linked Data before, this value is
even better at 85.94, clearly in the "excellent" range.

The participants were moreover given the possibility to provide further
feedback in a free-text field. We received a variety of comments for
further improvement, but except for the point that the required local
installation was somewhat inconvenient, no point was mentioned more than
once. 

The other comments concerned the search page being confusing (this
part of the interface was indeed not the focus of the study), the lack
of support for batch publishing of multiple similar nanopublications,
the lack of integrated ORCID lookup, the relatively small number of
general-purpose templates, the lack of RDF prefix recognition, the fact
that not all lengthy URIs are masked with readable labels in the user
interface, and the fact that the confirmation checkbox did not mention
the possibility of retraction. 

A further comment was that a command-line
interface would have been preferred in the particular context of the
given participant. Such a command-line interface actually exists (as
part of the nanopub-java library \[32\]) but was not the focus of this
study.

## Discussion and Conclusion

The results of the performance study described above confirm that the
tested kinds of queries can be efficiently answered by at least one of
the two types of services, and that these two service types are indeed
complementary. The grlc services run reliably and fast on the types of
queries they are designed for. The LDF services can run most of these
kinds of queries too, albeit in a much slower fashion, and they are
reasonably fast for simple kinds of unrestricted queries. 

The results of
the usability study indicate that our Nanobench client application
connecting to these services is indeed easily and efficiently usable,
even for users with no prior experience in Linked Data publishing.

In future work, we are planning to improve a number of aspects of the
involved tools and methods. For example, our approach does not yet
exploit the full potential of replication in our decentralized setting.
Existing work has shown that a client-side algorithm can enable
effective load-balancing over TPF servers \[33\], and we plan to extend
this work to QPF. 

As another example, our otherwise decentralized
approach currently uses centralized ORCID identifiers. We are therefore
investigating decentralized forms of authentication, such as
[WebID-OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec) or an approach similar to the web of trust \[34\], where
public keys are found based on personal trust relationships that could
themselves be published as nanopublications.

Such a web of trust could then also allow users in the future to find
trustworthy services. This could include meta services whose task is to
monitor and test other kinds of services, so clients could make an
informed decision on which service instances to rely on. This is
currently difficult, as there is no guarantee that all services are
well-behaved and return complete and correct results. Clients could
already now deal with this by taking random samples of nanopublications
from the publishing servers and check whether the query services
correctly return them, but this is quite resource intensive.

Another issue that needs to be taken care of in future work is identity
management when private keys are compromised, lost, or simply replaced
as a measure of precaution. For that, we envisage that introduction
nanopublications are extended so users can also list old public keys. 

On top of that, we are going to need a method for users to re-claim old
nanopublications they signed with an old key that has since been
compromised by a third party (possibly by linking to them with an index
nanopublication signed with a new key). 

This will also require
modifications in how we deal with retracted and superseded
nanopublications, as they might then be signed with a different key.
This is not trivial but can be dealt with within our framework, as
opposed to Blockchain-based solutions where identity is inseparably
linked to private key access. 

Currently, users need to install Nanobench
locally to ensure secure private key access and proper decentralization,
but a more flexible and more powerful handling of private keys as
explained above will also allow us to provide login-based public
Nanobench instances with their own sets of private keys, which in turn
can significantly increase the ease of use of our approach.

More work is also needed on the templating features to also cover the
provenance and publication info graphs. We also plan to more closely
align our templating vocabulary with existing RDF shape standards.

Moreover, we are working on making our templating approach more general
and more powerful, by adding repeatable statement patterns among other
features, such that we can express, for example, templates of templates
and thereby allow users to create and publish their own templates
directly via Nanobench.

The tools and applications we described above in a sense just scratch
the surface of what can become possible with our general approach in the
nearer future, from Linked Data publications of the latest scientific
findings, to formally organized argumentation and automated real-time
aggregations. 

We believe that our approach of semantic
micro-contributions could in fact be the starting point of bringing
Linked Data publishing to the masses.
