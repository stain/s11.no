Thrust & Roadmap Milestones \\
\midrule
\makecell[l]{Definition of common\\workflow patterns and\\benchmarks} &
\bp{14.4cm}{
    Define small sets of workflow patterns and benchmark deliverables, and implement them using a selected set of workflow systems
    \\
    Investigate automatic generation of patterns and configurable benchmarks (e.g., to enable weak and strong scaling experiments)
    \\
    Establish or leverage a centralized repository to host and curate patterns and benchmarks
}
\\
\midrule

\makecell[l]{Identifying paths toward\\interoperability of workflow\\systems} &
\bp{14.4cm}{
    Define interoperability for different roles, develop a horizontal interoperability (i.e., making interoperable components), and establish a requirements document per abstraction layer
    \\
    Develop real-world workflow benchmarks, use cases for interoperability, and common APIs that represent workflow library components
    \\
    Establish a workflow systems developer community
}
\\
\midrule

\makecell[l]{Improving workflow systems'\\interface with legacy and\\ emerging HPC software and\\hardware stacks} &
\bp{14.4cm}{
    Document a machine-readable description of key properties of widely used sites, and remote authentication needs from the workflow perspective
    \\
    Identify new workflow patterns (e.g., motivated by AI workflows), attain portability across heterogeneous hardware, and develop a registry of execution environment information
    \\
    Organize a community event involving workflow system developers, end users, authentication technology providers, and facility operators
