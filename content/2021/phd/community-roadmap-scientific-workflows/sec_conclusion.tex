\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have documented and summarized the wealth of information acquired as a result of two virtual ``Workflows Community Summits." The goal of these summits was to identify the common and current challenges faced by the workflows community, and outline a vision for short- and long-term community activities to address these challenges. From this vision, we have defined a community roadmap consisting of 12 milestones, which proposes solutions and technical approaches for achieving that vision. This initial series of successful events reinforces the need for continued engagement among workflow researchers, developers, and users, as well as enlarging the scope of the community to also embrace key stakeholders (e.g., computing facility operators and funding agency representatives) for enabling the proposed vision and roadmap.
