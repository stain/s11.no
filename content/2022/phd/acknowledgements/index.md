## Personal acknowledgements

This thesis would not have been possible without the tremendous support I have been so incredibly lucky to get from my closest and dearest throughout my PhD journey.

First of all I must thank my wonderful and amazing wife Gaby. You are my strongest pillar, making me motivated and focused, supporting me even when I have been difficult or absent-minded. I could not have done this without your love, and I am forever grateful. ¡Te amo con todo mi corazón!

Much of my daily joy comes from the my children,
and I am glad for all the time we have together -- including during COVID-19 lockdown when work, study and life mixed all up! (apologies to readers if you find any Odd Squad references). You will probably insist I also thank Waldo -- OK, he has also been there, although mostly sleeping in his little corner!

I want to thank my family in Norway -- specially my parents who have been encouraging me throughout, and my siblings and cousins who always make it a pleasure to "come home" and give me regular updates. Thank you to all my friends, in particular Laura, Juan, Ian, Sverre, Erlend, and Magnus.

I am forever in debt to Paul Groth and I want to thank you for agreeing to supervise me as your PhD student, which must have been challenging at the best of times.
I have enjoyed working with you since we first started talking about provenance and workflows more than a decade ago!
Thank you for all your patience, persistence and for your pragmatic directions that kept me on track. Thanks also to the [INDE lab](https://indelab.org/people/) at University of Amsterdam, particularly for the daily colleaguality we got during lockdown -- I wish I could have spent more time with you in person!

Thank you to Carole Goble, you have always been supporting me in so many ways since I started working for you in 2006, and you convinced me to start this PhD in the first place! No wonder you kept asking if I was finished yet! I appreciate our friendship and how you have mentored me to grow from a geeky developer to an acedemic. I hope we continue our exciting collaborations as "proper" colleagues!

I am so happy to have worked at the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/people/) at The University of Manchester for all these years and during this PhD. I particularly want to thank Shoaib Sufi for your wisdom and our deep conversations, not to mention your reliability whenever I have been stunned by bureaucracy or other struggles -- I've probably been the oddest person for you to line manage!
Thank you to all my amazing colleagues at the eScience Lab -- specially Stuart, Finn, Aleks, Nick, Munazah, Alan, Doug, Oliver, Eli, Phil, Aleksander -- you are a pleasure to work with, not just for your skills and expertise, but also your friendship and support.

I want to thank Meznah, you have been in the odd position of being co-supervised by me for your own PhD, and at the same time pushing me to finish mine! You bring such a joy with everything you do! Thanks to my fellow PhD and EngD students in Manchester: Fuqi, Ebitsam, Yo -- you inspire me! Thanks to Rudolf Wittner, your productive provenance visits to Manchester have hopefully helped your PhD as much as mine!

I also want to thank Andrew Stewart, Uli Sattler and the rest of Department of Computer Science, who have been so accommodating, and you are now welcoming me again as I step into the academic world fully. It's not like you didn't prepare me!
I also want to thank the UCU union members in Manchester [(UMUCU)](https://manchester.web.ucu.org.uk/) -- particularly Bijan and Ben for their personal support. I may have lost track of how many times we've been on the picket line during this PhD (no, I didn't manage to do much writing on strike days), but you have also showed me not to give up! Thank you to the engaging University of Manchester Students' Union, for standing up for what is right!


## Community acknowledgements

I am grateful for all the wonderful discussions, technical contributrions and long-lasting friendships formed in the [RO-Crate community](#communitylist) since its early inception [[Ó Carragáin 2019a]] at Workshop on Research Objects [(RO2018)](https://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/). Without you there would not have been any RO-Crate!

I would particularly like to thank Peter Sefton, without whose co-chairing, enthusiasm and pragmatism I would easily had got lost in the weeds. I am forever in debt to Eoghan Ó Carragáin who managed to get me and Peter to agree even on the trickiest issues, and led the community through its formative years.

I want to thank Simone Leo, whose persistent work and leadership on [Workflow Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/) and the RO-Crate Python library [[De Geest 2023a]] has shown that RO-Crate works in practice even for detailed provenance.

Thank you to Bruno Kinoshita who kindly (and on his own initiative) helped proof this whole thesis, you have contributed to our common goals in so many ways, going back to when we first worked on Semantic Web, Apache Jena, and Common Workflow Language and later RO-Crate.

I am very grateful to Daniel Garijo, with whom I have enjoyed many insightful discussions and idea developments for more than a decade (since the early days of Research Objects!), from the cellar of Dagstuhl to beaches of San Diego! I appreciate your enthusiasm and many invaluable and constructive contributions to manuscripts, specifications and code.

I want to thank Leyla Jael Castro, for your continuous positivity and drive, and for pushing us to run RO-Crate training workshops together with Núria Queralt Rosinach, Claus Weiland and Jonas Grieb. I always appreciate our discussions and writing together, and I am so glad that you are much better than me to remember submission deadlines!

RO-Crate is standing on the shoulders of giants, and I would like to thank the whole Research Object community [[Goble 2018]] for persisting on the early RO ideas [[Newman 2009], [Bechhofer 2013]]. I have particular fond memories of whiteboard sessions with Sean Bechhofer, Khalid Belhajjame, Paolo Missier, David De Roure, and Kevin Page in the productive [Wf4Ever project](https://s11.no/2020/archive/wf4ever/) that laid the foundation for what is now RO-Crate.

This PhD is in many ways born out of
[ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), not just
through the many fruitful co-authorships
(section [B.1](../contributions/#my-contributions)),
but also as the "ELIXIR way" of working is emblematic for the approach taken by RO-Crate community: open collaborations where institutional and project boundaries are blurred out in favour of jointly building pragmatic solutions.

I would like to thank the lovely people of ELIXIR Belgium (incl. Frederik, Ignacio, Paul, Rafael, Bert), ELIXIR Spain (incl. José Mª, Laura, Salva, Adam, Pau), ELIXIR HUB (incl. Justin, Jonathan, Marieke, Gavin, Niklas, Katharina), ELIXIR DE (incl. Björn, Anika, Sebastian, Nils, Michael), ELIXIR CH (Alex, Patricia), ELIXIR UK (incl. Susanna, Nicola, Xenia, Tim, Neil), ELIXIR NL (Núria, Egon, Chris, Marco, Rob, Helena) and many others I may have missed listing. I want to particularly thank everyone who organized and participated in the [ELIXIR Biohackathons](https://biohackathon-europe.org/) which always inspires me and has helped build our communities.

This thesis frequently mentions the Common Workflow Language[^1], and many of the ideas spur out of methods that were first tried by the [CWL community](https://www.commonwl.org/contributors/) (see for example [[Möller 2017],[Robinson 2017],[Khan 2019],[Crusoe 2022]]), which I am grateful for. I want to thank Michael Crusoe, not just for your tiredless work on bringing CWL together and willingness to put FAIR workflow theories into practice, but also for our enduring friendship and your support throughout most of the rabbit holes I have ventured into. I want to thank Peter Amstutz,
Hervé Ménager and the rest of the CWL leadership team and the many volunteers.

I also need to thank members of the [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/) community, particularly Hadley, Jonathon, Raja, Dennis, Vahan, Janisha, Amanda, and Nicola.
I thank the [Workflows Community Initiative](https://workflows.community/) in particular Sean R. Wilkinson, Rafael Ferreira da Silva, and Kyle Chard.

From the [FAIR Digital Object Forum](https://fairdo.org/) I need to place particular thanks to Peter Wittenburg, Luiz Olavo Bonino da Silva Santos, Maggie Hellström, Christophe Blanchi, Ulrich Schwardmann and Rainer Stotzka. I also want to thank all the members of the [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/)'s FAIR Digital Object Fabric interest group.

Mark Wilkinson, we first worked together on BioMoby services and Taverna workflows, which seems a long way from where we are today with FAIR! Looking back from this thesis, perhaps we could consider those to be early FAIR digital objects as well? I want to thank you for your enthusiasm, and for bringing me in to the Apples2Apples hackathons -- thank you also to Robert, Richard, Wilko, David, Alban, and Allyson.

Thank you to Egon Willighagen, I always enjoy our conversations, be it in the wind at Zandvoort, at the warmth of a Biohackathon cabin, or at Mastodon. I am indebted for your help and your Dutch expertise!

I am indebted to Herbert van de Sompel -- our conversations on the topic of aggregations, annotations, mementos and the Web started more than a decade ago; your clear ideas and powerful visions are at the heart of what this thesis tries to achieve. I am always energised by your talks, and truly appreciate working with you to promote FAIR Signposting and hope we will continue such exciting work together.
