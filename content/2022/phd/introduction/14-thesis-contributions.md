# Main Contributions

The contributions from this PhD include:

  - An evaluation of FAIR Digital Objects and Linked Data, considering them from a developer perspective as distributed object systems.

  - A Research Object implementation based on familiar Web technologies, adapted and extended by numerous research projects and software developers.

  - A profile to capture provenance of computational workflow runs using this implementation, implemented by at least six workflow management systems.

These contributions have not evolved in isolation, but in co-development with multiple international collaborations (see Appendix [\[ch11:acknowledgements\]](#ch11:acknowledgements)).

# Thesis Overview

Chapter [\[chapter:background\]](#chapter:background) gives the background of the concepts *FAIR Digital Object* (FDO) and *Linked Data*, including a brief history of the *Semantic Web*, followed by a critical analysis of these technologies and their use.

Chapter [\[chapter:fdo\]](#chapter:fdo) targets RQ1 and contributes a framework-based evaluation of Linked Data and FDO as possible architectures for implementing a distributed object system for the purpose of FAIR data publishing. The discussion in this chapter considers how the two approaches can benefit from each other’s strengths.

Chapter [\[chapter:ro-crate\]](#chapter:ro-crate) addresses RQ2 by introducing the contribution of *RO-Crate*—a pragmatic data packaging mechanism using Linked Data standards to implement FDO and be extensible for domain-specific metadata.

Chapter [\[chapter:workflows\]](#chapter:workflows) considers RQ3 by exploring the relationship between Computational Workflows and FAIR practices using RO-Crate and FDO, with use cases from molecular dynamics and specimen digitization. The contribution of the *Workflow Run Crate profiles* is presented as an interoperable way to capture and publish workflow execution provenance.

Chapter [\[chapter:conclusions\]](#chapter:conclusions) summarises and discusses the contributions from this thesis, reflects on later third-party developments and concludes by evaluating the research questions.
